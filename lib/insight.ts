/**
 * What the most recent lab sample measured, as a phrase rather than a sentence:
 * "5 MPN/100mL, below the EPA safe swimming limit of 104".
 *
 * A phrase because the date leads the line now and this sits beside it. As a
 * full sentence it opened "The most recent lab sample measured...", which
 * restated the section heading and the date that now precedes it before
 * reaching the number.
 *
 * Built here rather than lifted out of the backend's `insight` narrative. That
 * narrative is a paragraph covering the weather, the model's drivers and the
 * beach's base rate as well as the sample, and this section is supposed to say
 * one thing. Reading the two published numbers directly is both shorter and
 * steadier than trying to cut one clause out of generated prose.
 *
 * Says nothing about how old the sample is: that sits on its own line, where it
 * is the thing this section most wants a reader to notice. No em dashes.
