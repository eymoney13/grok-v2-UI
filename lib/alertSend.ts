// The daily alert run: find the beaches that came back elevated, work out who
// asked to hear about them, and send one email per person.
//
// Three rules shape this, and each exists to stop a specific way an alert list
// turns into spam:
//
//  1. ONLY "Not recommended" (the 50%+ tier) counts as elevated. The yellow
//     "Slightly elevated" tier fires far too often to stay meaningful.
//  2. A beach elevated today is worth an email today, whether or not it was
//     elevated yesterday. This is a daily "is my beach safe this morning"
//     read, not a notification about a change of state: someone deciding
//     whether to swim needs telling on day three of a bad stretch as much as
//     on day one. What stops it becoming repetitive is the dedupe below, which
//     is keyed on the PREDICTION DATE - so a stretch sends one email per day,
//     and re-running a day's refresh sends nothing extra.
//  3. A subscriber gets ONE email covering all of their elevated beaches, not
//     one per beach.

// Where the unsubscribe links point.
