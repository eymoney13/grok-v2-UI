// stops being enough on its own.
//
// FREE READERS NEVER AUTHENTICATE. There is no route protection anywhere (see
// proxy.ts): an anonymous reader gets the free board, and signing in is
// something you do because you pay, not something the site asks of you on the
// way in. This function returning false is the normal case, not an error.
