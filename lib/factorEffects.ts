// Plain-language explanation of how one contributing factor is affecting the
// water, for the list under "Top contributing factors".
//
// The ranked list on its own names things without explaining them: "Hours since
// high tide" is the model's vocabulary, not a swimmer's, and a reader who does
// not already know why it matters learns nothing from seeing it ranked first.
// These lines answer the only question the list raises.
//
// WRITTEN FOR SOMEONE STANDING ON THE BEACH. One sentence, no jargon, and no
// em dashes. Each says what is happening and why it matters to the water, in
// that order, so the sentence stays readable if the reader stops halfway.
//
// No numbers either, with one deliberate exception: rain names its depth. A
// direction alone cannot separate a downpour from 0.7 mm, and describing the
// latter as "recent rain washing bacteria off streets" contradicted the summary
// directly above it, which called the same day dry. The depth is the only thing
// that reconciles the two, so rain is measured out loud and nothing else is.
//
// Keyed by the canonical display label from lib/factors.ts, which is the same
// string the list itself shows, so a label that renders has an entry here.
// Direction comes from the model's SHAP sign: the same factor reads opposite
// ways on different days, and saying "strong sunlight is killing bacteria" on a
// day the model scored sunlight as *raising* risk would be backwards.

  // "Mid-morning" and not "the reading" or "the sample": 10:00 is a fixed
  // stand-in for when the county draws its water, not a prediction timestamp
  // and not a test that happened today (most days there is no sample at all).
  // Real collection times run roughly 07:00-12:45, median 09:30, with only 44%
  // within an hour of 10:00 -- so the anchor is approximate, and a phrase
  // implying a specific event would overstate it.

  // `raising` used to say "Enough time has passed since high tide for bacteria

  // 10-12h, and the model agrees -- its own predicted risk falls from 39.3% to
  // 19.8% across that span (corr -0.43 within 0-12h).
