// FIRST DRAFT.
//
// NOTHING HERE IS INVENTED. There are no quotes, no testimonials, no metrics,
// no partners and no photographs, because the repository contains none that are
// verified (see docs/SANDBOX_UI_HANDOFF.md, which records that the source PDF's
// names and credentials were never confirmed). The scaffold this replaces had
// four empty quote cards and two "[Metric]" slots; both are gone rather than
// filled, since a fake card is worse than an honest absence.
//
// Max's illness is told as HIS EXPERIENCE and as the reason the company exists.
// It does not claim a water test established a cause, because no such test is
// in evidence. Keep it that way.
//
// The one place a future story could go is the invitation at the end, which
// asks for stories instead of pretending to have them.

// The mailbox a person actually reads. Mirrors lib/alertSend.ts's REPLY_TO
// rather than importing it, which would pull the server-only mail stack into a
// page; the fallback is deliberately the same string so the two cannot drift
// apart silently.

      <p className={s.eyebrow}>The surf trip that started it</p>
      <p className={s.originLede}>Project Neptune began after co-founder Max became seriously ill with a staph infection following a surf trip in Mexico.
</p>
      <p>He spent eight days in the hospital receiving IV antibiotics, followed by two more weeks of treatment at home.</p>
      <p>The experience left us with a question. What if people could check the likely water quality before getting in, as easily as they check the weather?</p>
    </section>

    <EditorialSection number="01" title="The problem">
      <h3>The water can change before the next test</h3>
      <p>Official water testing is essential, but a sample captures conditions at one place and time. Lab results can take a day or two, while rain, runoff, and ocean conditions keep changing.</p>
      <p>That leaves a gap between what the last test showed and what someone wants to know before going in today.</p>
    </EditorialSection>

    <EditorialSection number="02" title="What we&rsquo;re building">
      <h3>A forecast for the water</h3>
      <p>Neptune uses years of official bacteria test results and current environmental conditions to estimate the chance of elevated bacteria at each beach. We turn that forecast into a simple Neptune Index so people can make a more informed choice.</p>
      <p>It complements official advisories and closures. It does not replace them.</p>
