// Names, the "PhD" on Ryan, and both founder bios came from the owner. Nothing
// here is inferred: no job title beyond Co-founder and Scientific advisor, no
// degrees beyond the one supplied, no quotes, and no bio for Ryan, because
// none was given and inventing one for a named scientist would be worse than
// leaving the space quiet.
//
// The scaffold's "Founder story" section is gone. It did not vanish: Max's
// illness is told properly on /sandbox/stories, and a second, shorter telling
// here would compete with it. The closing links there instead.
//
// AN ADVISOR ROW WAS HERE and was pulled at the owner's request pending the
// advisor's own sign-off. Restoring it needs three things back: this JSX

 * See public/team/README.md for the expected filenames.
