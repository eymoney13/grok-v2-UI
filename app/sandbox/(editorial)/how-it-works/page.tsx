It is hard to test seawater for every germ that might make you ill, so agencies test for Enterococcus instead and use it as an indicator: more of it suggests a greater chance that sewage or runoff has reached the water. Finding it does not identify any particular illness or organism. It is a signal worth paying attention to, not a diagnosis.",
  },
  {
    q: "Does Neptune collect its own water samples?",
    a: "No. Neptune does not sample, test, or measure water. Every lab result it learns from was collected by an official monitoring program. What Neptune adds is a forecast between those tests, built from that record plus current conditions.",
  },
  {
    q: "Does this replace official advisories?",
    a: "No, and it is not meant to. A posted closure or advisory comes from people who sampled that water and have the authority to act on it. Neptune is an estimate. If the two ever disagree, the official notice is the one that counts. Check it before you get in.",
  },
  {
    q: "Why does the forecast change?",
    a: "Because the ocean does. A day of rain, a big swell or a spring tide can all move the estimate, and Neptune recalculates once a day with the latest conditions. A beach that read Low yesterday can read Moderate today.",

    <EditorialSection number="01" title="Why a forecast helps">
      <p>Official testing is the ground truth, and Neptune would not exist without it. But it has a gap built into it: samples are typically collected about once a week, and the lab needs another 24 to 48 hours to grow and count what is in them.</p>
      <p>So the number posted today describes water that was scooped up days ago. It gives you a rearview mirror into how the water was. In between samples and results, it rains, tides turn, and swells arrive. That is the space a forecast fills, what the water should be like today, and in the future.</p>

      {/* The gap, drawn rather than described. Two tracks on one timeline: the
          sampling track is sparse and lands late, the forecast track is
          continuous. aria-hidden with a text equivalent above, because a
          screen reader gains nothing from the dots. */}

    <EditorialSection number="03" title="What the risk levels mean">
      <p>The Neptune Index is a percentage. It is our model’s estimated probability that enterococcus exceeds {EPA_MPN_THRESHOLD} MPN/100mL at that beach. A lower percentage means an exceedance is less likely. A higher percentage means it is more likely.</p>

      {/* Read straight off RISK_TIERS so the bands and colors here can never
          drift from the legend on the board. */}
      <ul className={s.tierKey}>
        {RISK_TIERS.map((tier) => (
          <li key={tier.label}>
            <span className={s.tierSwatch} style={{ backgroundColor: tier.color }} />
            <span className={s.tierRange} style={{ color: tier.textColor }}>{tier.range}%</span>
            <span className={s.tierName}>{tier.label}</span>
          </li>
        ))}
      </ul>

      <p>Those labels come from the relationship we see in the record. When past forecasts are lined up against the official lab results that followed them, samples predicted in the lower ranges have tended to come back with lower bacteria levels, and samples predicted in the higher ranges have tended to come back higher.</p>
      <p>So the labels describe a likelihood, and how that likelihood has borne out. They are not measured bacteria counts, is it the probability of unsafe levels of bacteria for that day. </p>

      <p className={s.annotation}>A low reading means conditions look unfavorable for high bacteria, not that the water has been tested and cleared. A high reading is a reason for caution, not a closure. Official advisories and closures take precedence over anything on this page.</p>
