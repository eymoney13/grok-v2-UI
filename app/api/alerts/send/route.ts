// The daily alert pass: mails everyone whose beaches turned elevated today.
//
// Deliberately separate from /api/trigger: that one only dispatches the GitHub
// workflows that GENERATE the day's data, and this one reads the result.
// Running them from one route would mean sending alerts off whatever data
// happened to be committed before the workflows finished.
//
// TWO WAYS IN, and both are safe to fire because alert_notifications makes a
// repeat run a no-op:
//
//  1. project-neptune's daily-refresh workflow curls this endpoint as its last
//     step, once the day's predictions are published. This is the one that
//     matters: it fires the moment the data exists rather than at a guessed
//     hour, and it covers a MANUALLY re-run refresh too, which a clock-based
//     cron cannot.
//
//  2. A once-daily Vercel Cron, as a backstop for a workflow that published but
//     never called in. This project is on the Hobby plan, where crons are
//     limited to one run per day, so this cannot poll for late data - which is
//     exactly why path 1 is the primary.
//
// A run where no beach is elevated sends nothing, and a run where the day's
// predictions have not been published yet sends nothing and waits. There is no
// catch-up: yesterday's exceedance is not mailed out today.

  // A rehearsal: run the whole selection and report who WOULD be mailed,
  // without sending or recording anything. Stays behind the same auth as a
  // real run, because the response names subscribers.
