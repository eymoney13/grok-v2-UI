// A SKELETON, not this beach's explanation blurred over. lib/paywall.ts strips
// the drivers, the conditions, the lab sample and the accuracy record on the
// server, so none of it is in the page to cover up — blurring in CSS would hide
// nothing from anyone who opens devtools, which is the whole reason the
// withholding happens upstream. These are grey bars shaped like the real
// sections so the panel keeps its proportions, and nothing is invented: no
// numbers, no factor names, no readings.
//
// Two blocks, not three: the forecast-confidence card renders for real below
// this, unblurred, because its headline percentage is free. A third grey block
// shaped like it would read as a second, locked copy of the panel underneath.
